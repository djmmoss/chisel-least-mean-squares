# chisel-least-mean-squares

This is a basic Least Mean Squares (LMS) hardware implementation in Chisel.

## Adder Tree

Since `reduce` does not create a balanced tree, the adder tree is constructed using the `reduceTree` function.

## Usage

Please use the makefile to build and run the project. Shoutout to ucb-bar for their makefile.
